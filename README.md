## AirPlanner: clear your commute through Geneva!

### The problem
Particulate matter pollution is very fine dust in the air that affects people's health in different ways, as pointed out by WHO standards. In order to enhance air quality we need to get accurate data on how this particulates are distributed. But air quality is a dynamic parameter that changes fast, making it difficult for fixed sensors (the usual cities' approach) to get a responsive map. One of the situations where people get systematically exposed to air pollution is during commute, during rush hours that make the situation even worse. Is there a way to generate data on the go that allow people to reduce exposure and, at the same time, generate useful information?

### Our plan
We plan to combine the power of open source hardware and low cost sensors with the scale provided by bike sharing services. We will attach a particulate matter sensor to each bike, that will send data to a map accessible through an app. From this map, anyone can plan a route to work or school based not only on how fast you get to your destination, but also how healthy your way will be. Data from bikers will also be indicative of pollution sources, serving as a base for future mitigation plans.

**Are you...?**
- Interested in knowing more about air pollution exposure?
- The owner of an electric bike?
- Maker, hacker, Engineer, Scientist, tech-tinkering person?
- Android/App developer?
- Data person?

*Then you can contribute to make LogAir grow!*

### How can you contribute? 
- Install a device in your electric bike, so we can test it;
- Check the [assembly instructions](instructions.md) and build your own device to attach to your bike;
- Enhance the hardware design (electronics and case);
- Help us develop an Android app to visualize data on the go;
- Develop data visualizations and mapping alternatives;
- Translate instructions or develop better outreach material;
- Ride one of our ready-installed bikes!
